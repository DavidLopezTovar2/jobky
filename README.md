# Jobky

Project developed with the stack of mern (mongo, express, react, node)

## Based on

- React 18
- Express 4.18
- Mongoose 6.4

## What's jobky about?

The idea of jobky came from an issue currently happening in my country (Colombia) is that the rotation of people working on restaurants has increased in recent years due to the lack of motivation on the employee to stay. So the idea is that with this project people and restaurant can register and submit a profile of the employee or the vacancy from the restaurant. The tool matches people and restaurants according to some specifications on both sides.

The project will continue to be develop on a new private repo.

## What's inside the project?

- CRUD for the vacancies created by restaurants
- CRUD for the employees that created profile
- List of the vacancies 
- The ui was develop using React-Bootrap, Formik, Lottie-web, Sweetalert2 and Yup
- When the restaurant selects a vacancy created. It has the posibility to gather all the users that can apply to its vacancy from the data uploaded
